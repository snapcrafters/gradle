description: |
  Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for
  multi-language development. If you are building, testing, publishing, and
  deploying software on any platform, Gradle offers a flexible model that can
  support the entire development lifecycle from compiling and packaging code to
  publishing web sites. Gradle has been designed to support build automation
  across multiple languages and platforms including Java, Scala, Android, C/C++,
  and Groovy, and is closely integrated with development tools and continuous
  integration servers including Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Jenkins.
